# Exposed Naming

In rare circumstances, you might like to quickly export (that is, make as an output of the entire model) some output of a node whose name gets replaced in the actual ONNX compilation. For example, the name of the export of the first output of a repeated block will get overridden by the name of the export that comes last (i.e., a reference to `MyOutput` would actual refer to `MyOutput$5`, the last output in a repeated block). If you would like to refer to the original `MyOutput`, you can set `exposed="yes"` as an attribute of the node. Inside that node, names of inputs (things specified with the input tag) won't get overridden.
